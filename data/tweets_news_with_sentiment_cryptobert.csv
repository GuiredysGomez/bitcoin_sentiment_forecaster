Adam Back,@BobMcElrath @TTrevethan @PeterMcCormack @Liquid_BTC you can't use client state for backups. seeds are better ergonomics. small blobs in a non-consensus area for a descriptor and a few paths is fine. people will otherwise store it on op_returns which uses up transaction space.,2023-12-31 04:53:00+00:00,0,2,0
